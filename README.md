# 🌐 GenericsKB Knowledge Base System

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a **Java-based Knowledge Base Management System** designed to store, query, and update general world knowledge derived from the **GenericsKB dataset** — a large collection of verified factual statements such as *“Dogs bark”* or *“Trees remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.”*  

The application provides a **proof of concept** for how artificial intelligence systems can manage and reason with structured common-sense knowledge.  
Users can load data, search for specific items, update existing statements, or add new knowledge entries through an interactive interface.

Two implementations are included:
1. **GenericsKbArrayApp** — uses a traditional array for data storage.  
2. **GenericsKbBSTApp** — uses a Binary Search Tree (BST) for more efficient search and insertion operations.

## ⚙️ Features
- Load and parse structured text-based knowledge datasets.
- Store and manage knowledge entries in memory.
- Add new knowledge or update existing statements (based on confidence scores).
- Search for items by term or by both term and sentence.
- Compare data structure performance (Array vs BST).
- Modular object-oriented Java design.
- Automated build and documentation generation via `Makefile` and `javadoc`.
